# JIRA Stories

This directory contains future enhancement stories that are not currently prioritized for implementation.

## Current Stories

### Low Priority
- **STORY-001**: Add Google Sign-In Support (8 pts, 🔴 Backend blocker)

### Medium Priority
- **STORY-002**: Add Apple Sign-In Support (5 pts, ⚠️ Required if Google Sign-In added)

## How to Use

Each story is in its own markdown file with:
- Full description and acceptance criteria
- Technical implementation details
- Story point estimates
- Dependencies and blockers clearly marked

Copy and paste the entire story content into JIRA when ready to prioritize.

## Priority Definitions

- **Low**: Nice to have, no immediate user request
- **Medium**: Should be done eventually, may have external requirements
- **High**: Important for user experience or business goals
- **Critical**: Blockers or security issues

## Adding New Stories

Create a new file following the pattern:
```
STORY-XXX-brief-name.md
```

Use the existing stories as templates for consistent formatting.
