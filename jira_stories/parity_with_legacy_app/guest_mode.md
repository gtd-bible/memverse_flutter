# Story: Implement Guest Mode

**Story Point Estimate:** 3
**Priority:** Medium

## Description
The legacy app requires login. To improve onboarding, we want to allow users to use the app in a "Guest Mode" without immediately creating an account.

## Requirements
1.  Add "Continue as Guest" button on Login Screen.
2.  Skip Authentication flow.
3.  Store data locally only (or prompt to sync later).
4.  Restrict features that absolutely require server (e.g., global leaderboards) if applicable.
